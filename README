REQUIRE
------

A D compiler: ldc, gdc, dmd
Standard library Phobos with his devel file
libsqlite

BUILD
------

* With Bash scryt:
run build.sh script as
$ ./build.sh

use -h paramter for more info
$ ./build.sh -h

* With Makefile:
see README here: https://github.com/bioinfornatics/MakefileForD

** as shared lib:
$ make all-shared geany-tag DFLAGS_IMPORT="-Isrc"  DFLAGS="-O -w -g"

** as static lib:
$ make all geany-tag DFLAGS_IMPORT="-Isrc"  DFLAGS="-O -w -g"

INSTALL
-------
* With Bash scrypt:
It is quite easy after building just copy:
$ su -c 'cp -r install/* /'

* With Makefile as shared lib:
$ sudo make -j4 install-shared install-geany-tag  LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64 PREFIX=/usr

* With Makefile as static lib:
$ sudo make -j4 install-static install-geany-tag  LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64 PREFIX=/usr


If you build as shared lib remember to run ldconfig:
    If you have used default prefix
    $ su -c 'ldconfig /usr/local/lib'

    If you have set lib dir as lib64
    $ su -c 'ldconfig /usr/local/lib64'

    If you have set prefix as /usr
    $ su -c 'ldconfig'

EXAMPLES
--------
for build and test example you need link to your sqlite library. I assume DSQLite lib is in prefix /usr/local/ and sqlite lib in /usr/lib64:
$ ldc2 $(pkg-config --cflags --libs DSQLite) test_sql.d
$ ./test_sql
